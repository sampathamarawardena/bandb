Overview:  
A bed and breakfast (B&B) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast.  Staying at a B&B is the perfect choice of lodging when you need a relaxing escape. Easy to locate, much better value than hotels and personalized attention, delicious food are some of the reasons to choose a B&B over a hotel.   

A brief description of the proposed system is as follows.  

A person who wishes to rent out rooms in their homes can register with B&B. He can provide a brief description (location, number of rooms, facilities and price etc) of the accommodation along with a few pictures. 

Tourists who wishes to rent such an accommodation through B&B should first register with B&B. They can search on various available accommodation in a particular city. They could see the rating and reviews and choose the one that best suit. Selected rooms can be booked online and pay via online payment methods. 

After visiting, the tourist can leave any comments on the accommodation and rate it. This will be useful for the future tourists as well as the lodging renters. 

The system keeps track of number of visits of a particular accommodation. This will be useful for the tourists to get an idea on how long they have been in the business. 

The Objectives of this project are:  
 	      To develop a platform to register home renters, tourists and manage lodging information. 
   	    To search for available lodging on a selected destination and view ratings and reviews. 
    	   To complete a booking and payment online for the selected lodging  
   	    To comment and rate.
